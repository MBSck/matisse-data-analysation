   abstract = {We present observations of six isolated, pre-main-sequence, intermediate mass stars selected for shallow spectra at submillimeter wavelengths at 1.3, 2.6, 7.0, and 36 millimeters from the IRAM PdBI and the VLA. We analyze the new observations of these stars (HD34282, HD35187, HD142666, HD143006, HD150193, HD163296) together with similar observations of three additional stars from the literature (CQ Tau, UX Ori, TW Hya), in the context of self-consistent irradiated disk models. Our aim is to constrain the wavelength dependence of the dust opacity and the total dust mass in the disks. The shallow wavelength dependence of the opacity is confirmed and for a few stars extended to significantly longer wavelengths. For any plausible dust properties, this requires grain growth from interstellar sizes to maximum sizes of at least a few millimeters, and very likely to several centimeters or more. For four of the stars (HD34282, HD163296, CQ Tau, TW Hya), the millimeter emission has been spatially resolved, and the large disk radii (> 100 AU) rule out that high optical depths play a role. The mass of dust that has been processed into large grains is substantial, and in some cases implies a disk mass comparable to the mass of the central star.},

   abstract = {High-resolution imaging reveals a large morphological variety of protoplanetary disks. To date, no constraints on their global evolution have been found from this census. An evolutionary classification of disks was proposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I sources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of evolution than Group II. Disk evolution can be constrained from the comparison of disks with different properties. A first attempt of disk taxonomy is now possible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig Ae/Be stars becoming available. Near-IR images of six Group II disks in scattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in Polarimetric Differential Imaging, which is the most efficient technique to image the light scattered by the disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of this sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the literature. Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in the disk of HD163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure with a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (less than 100 AU) disk is detected around HD142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17 Herbig Ae/Be sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II is due to the presence or absence of a large disk cavity (larger than 5 AU). There is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group I to Group II. Group II are not evolved version of the Group I. Within the Group II disks, very different geometries (both self-shadowed and compact) exist. HD163296 could be the primordial version of a typical Group I. Other Group II, like AK Sco and HD142666, could be smaller counterpart of Group I unable to open cavities as large as those of Group I.},

   abstract = {Aims. We investigate the structure of the innermost region of three circumstellar disks around pre-main sequence stars HD 142666, AS 205 N, and AS 205 S. We determine the inner radii of the dust disks and, in particular, search for transition objects where dust has been depleted and inner disk gaps have formed at radii of a few tenths of AU up to several AU. Methods. We performed interferometric observations with IOTA, AMBER, and MIDI in the infrared wavelength ranges 1.6-2.5 μm and 8-13 μm with projected baseline lengths between 25 m and 102 m. The data analysis was based on radiative transfer simulations in 3D models of young stellar objects (YSOs) to reproduce the spectral energy distribution and the interferometric visibilities simultaneously. Accretion effects and disk gaps could be considered in the modeling approach. Results from previous studies restricted the parameter space. Results. The objects of this study were spatially resolved in the infrared wavelength range using the interferometers. Based on these observations, a disk gap could be found for the source HD 142666 that classifies it as transition object. There is a disk hole up to a radius of Rin = 0.30 AU and a (dust-free) ring between 0.35 AU and 0.80 AU in the disk of HD 142666. The classification of AS 205 as a system of classical T Tauri stars could be confirmed using the canonical model approach, i.e., there are no hints of disk gaps in our observations. © ESO, 2013.},

@article{Zwintz2009,
   abstract = {Context. Modeling of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars through asteroseismology of PMS p-mode pulsators has only recently become possible, and spacebased photometry is one of the important sources of data for these efforts. We present precise photometry of the pulsating Herbig Ae star HD 142666 obtained in two consecutive years with the MOST (Microvariability & Oscilations of STars) satellite. Aims. Previously, only a single pulsation period was known for HD 142666. The MOST photometry reveals that HD 142666 is multi-periodic. However, the unique identification of pulsation frequencies is complicated by the presence of irregular variability caused by the star's circumstellar dust disk. The two light curves obtained with MOST in 2006 and 2007 provided data of unprecedented quality to study the pulsations in HD 142666 and also to monitor the circumstellar variability. Methods. Frequency analysis was performed using the routine SIGSPEC and the results from the 2006 and 2007 campaigns were then compared to each other with the software CINDERELLA to identify frequencies common to both light curves. The correlated frequencies were then submitted to an asteroseismic analysis. Results. We attribute 12 frequencies to pulsation. Model fits to the three frequencies with the highest amplitudes lie well outside the uncertainty box for the star's position in the HR diagram based on published values. Some of the frequencies appear to be rotationally split modes. Conclusions. The models suggest that either (1) the published estimate of the luminosity of HD 142666, based on a relation between circumstellar disk radius and stellar luminosity, is too high and/or (2) additional physics such as mass accretion may be needed in our models to accurately fit both the observed frequencies and HD 142666's position in the HR diagram. © ESO 2009.},
