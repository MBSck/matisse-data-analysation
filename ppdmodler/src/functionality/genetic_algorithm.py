    """The genetic algorithm is a stochastic global search optimisation
    algorithm inspired by the biological theory of evolution by means of
    natural selection.
    Specifically, the new synthesis that combines an understanding of genetics
    with the theory

    The algorithm uses a genetic representation (bitstrings), fitness
    (functions evaluations), genetic recombination (crossover of bitstrings),
    and mutation (flipping bits)

    First the population of bistrings (candidate solutions) are evaluated for
    fitness (minimisation or maximisation), which is then taken as the fitness
    solution.

    Then, parents are selected based on their fitness by drawing k candidates
    from the population randomly and selecting the member from the group with
    the best fitness (tournament selection).

    Parents are taken in pairs and create two children by using a crossover
    operator, by splittig the both parents (in inverse for the second child,
    called 'onepoint crossover').

    Mutation involves flipping bits in created children candidate solutions.
    Typically the mutation rate is set to 1/L, where L is the length of the
    bitstring.

    bounds: List
